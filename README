To test website, you must start a local web server/database. On mac, install XAMPP and save the project code in "htdocs".

The database schema is included in the word documentation for the project and must be recreated for the website to function properly.

The database connection variables (tablename username, etc) in the files (dbh.inc.php, and recommender.py) must also be changed.

Python packages are detailed in the requirements.txt file.
